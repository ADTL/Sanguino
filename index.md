This is a Sanguino third-party hardware add-on for the Arduino IDE.

To use it, simply create a folder named hardware inside your sketchbook directory.
Now move the sanguino directory inside that folder. The structure would look like this:

/hardware/sanguino/etc.

A version compatible with the Arduino IDE 1.5.x is also available at the [ide-1.5.x branch]({{site.url}}/ide-1.5.x.html).
