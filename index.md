This is a Sanguino third-party hardware add-on for the Arduino IDE.

To use it, simply create a folder named hardware inside your sketchbook directory.
Now move the Sanguino directory inside that folder. The structure would look like this:

* Arduino/
	* hardware/
		* Sanguino/
			* avr/
			* bootloaders/
			* cores/
			* variants/
			* README.md
			* boards.txt

It's compatible with the Arduino IDE 1.5.x as well. See the following site for more information: <http://code.google.com/p/arduino/wiki/Platforms1>.
